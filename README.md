# Real-time Pose Estimation Motion Capture for Animation

This project combines 3D pose estimation and inverse kinematics to create a low-cost, markerless motion capture system for animating humanoid virtual models in Unity. Using MediaPipe and OpenCV for pose estimation, the system extracts 3D joint coordinates and streams them to Unity via UDP. Unity receives this data to animate a humanoid model using inverse kinematics (IK) or direct bone manipulation.
